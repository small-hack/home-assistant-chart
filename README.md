Who doesn't need more home assistant helm charts? This is a home assistant chart with some quality of life features.

#### Features

- values are documented [here](https://github.com/small-hack/home-assistant-chart/tree/main/charts/home-assistant#values) using [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs)
- Put a default `configuration.yaml`, `themes.yaml`, `automations.yaml`, and `scenes.yaml` in a place of your choosing with either:
  - your own ConfigMap
  - specifying an in-line yaml string for us to render as a ConfigMap for you
- 🆕 Create an initial "owner" admin user (disables the registration page)
  - supports existing k8s Secret for credentials
- 🆕 post install job to setup [hacs](https://hacs.xyz/)
- Kept up to date by RenovateBot

## TLDR

```bash
# add the chart repo to your helm repos
helm repo add home-assistant https://small-hack.github.io/home-assistant-chart

# download the values.yaml and edit it with your own values such as YOUR hostname
helm show values home-assistant/home-assistant > values.yaml

# install the chart
helm install --namespace home-assistant --create-namespace home-assistant/home-assistant --values values.yaml
```

## Tips

### Creating an initial owner user

Creating a user using plain text values. This would be your values:

```yaml
homeAssistant:
  owner:
    # -- whether to create an initial owner user to disable registration
    create: true
    # -- enable debug mode for the user creation job. WARNING: This reveals secret data
    debug: false
    # -- name of the owner user, ignored if owner.existingSecret is set
    name: "admin"
    # -- login username of the owner user, ignored if owner.existingSecret is set
    username: "admin"
    # -- login password of the owner user, ignored if owner.existingSecret is set
    password: ""
    # -- language of the owner user, ignored if owner.existingSecret is set
    language: "en"
    # -- if your home assistant is using ingress, this is the external url you connect to
    # NOTE: if using ingress, this should be the same hostname you specified for that
    # if using an internal IP for connecting, please use your IP for the url, like https://192.168.42.42/
    externalURL: "https://home-assistant.cooldogsonline.net/"
```

NOTE: for user creation to work successfully, you need to have a configuration.yaml file in place with all the basic info filled out. For more basic config defaults, see: [home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/basic](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/basic/)

#### User creation using an existing secret

This would be your values:

```yaml
homeAssistant:
  owner:
    create: true
    existingSecret: "home-assistant-owner"
```

This would be an example secret containing the important environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: home-assistant-owner
  # this should be the namespace you deploy this helm chart into
  namespace: home-assistant
type: Opaque
data:
  ADMIN_LANGUAGE: ZW4=
  ADMIN_NAME: YWRtaW4=
  ADMIN_PASSWORD: YWRtaW4=
  ADMIN_USERNAME: YWRtaW4=
  EXTERNAL_URL: aHR0cHM6Ly9oYS5leGFtcGxlLmNvbS8=
```

#### Troubleshooting User creation

Sometimes, the user creation job is buggy, as it is a hack anyway, so we take a DEBUG variable to output everything we get back from every command. If something has gone wrong, try deleting the helm release and then re-install with the following values:

```yaml
homeAssistant:
  owner:
    create: true
    # -- enable debug mode for the user creation job. WARNING: This reveals secret data
    debug: true
```

⚠️ WARNING: Enabling the debug variable for the user creation job will print sensitive data including authorization codes and bearer tokens!

### Setup hacs

We provide a post install hook job to setup [hacs](https://hacs.xyz/) for you. You can enable it like this:

```yaml
# persistence MUST be enabled to do this
persistence:
  # set to your preferred storageClass, this examples sets
  # storageClass to local-path which is default on k3s
  storageClass: "local-path"
  enabled: true

homeAssistant:
  setupHacsJobs:
    enabled: true
```

### Unit system, Temp Unit, and Time Zone

```yaml
homeAssistant:
  configuration: |
    homeassistant:
      time_zone: Europe/Amsterdam
      temperature_unit: C
      unit_system: metric
```

For more basic config defaults, see: [home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/basic](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/basic/)

### Making Ingress Nginx work for public domains

I had to add the IP range of the k8s cluster to my trusted proxies in my home assistant `configuration.yaml` (also since this was public, I needed to declare an `external_url`).
This is what I added to my `values.yaml` to do that through this chart:

```yaml
homeAssistant:
  configuration: |
    # this sets your extenral url
    homeassistant:
      external_url: 'https://iot.examplesforgooddogs.com'

    # this enables proxies such as the ingress nginx controller
    http:
      use_x_forwarded_for: true
      trusted_proxies:
        - 10.0.0.0/8
```


### Using an existing ConfigMap for configuration.yaml

For the ConfigMap, make sure your ConfigMap has a key called `configuration.yaml` with in-line yaml data like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-home-assistant-configmap
  namespace: home-assistant
data:
  configuration.yaml: |
    http:
      trusted_proxies:
      - 10.0.0.0/8
      use_x_forwarded_for: true
```

Then, you'd specify the name of your ConfigMap in your `values.yaml` like this:

```yaml
homeAssistant:
  existingConfigMap: "my-home-assistant-configmap"
```


### USB Devices

If you're on metal, make sure your device is accessible, which in the case of a USB device e.g. conbee II, will require you to install the [generic device plugin](https://github.com/squat/generic-device-plugin):

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat/generic-device-plugin/main/manifests/generic-device-plugin.yaml
```

#### Values.yaml

Tip from [pajikos/home-assistant](https://github.com/pajikos/home-assistant) for passing in USB devices via `values.yaml`:

```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: usb
    hostPath:
      path: >-
        /dev/serial/by-id/usb-ITEAD_SONOFF_Zigbee_3.0_USB_Dongle_Plus_V2_20230509111242-if00
      type: CharDevice

extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: usb
    mountPath: /dev/ttyACM0
    # note that this is readonly to prevent security issues
    readOnly: true
```

Keep in mind that if you're using a USB device, you may only be able to use it with one pod at a time, so you would need to also set the deployment strategy to `"Recreate"` so that the Deployment deletes one pod before creating another, instead of `"RollingUpdate"` which is the default Deployment behavior which will create another pod and make sure it's ready before deleting the old pod. If set to `"RollingUpdate"` (the default for all Deployments), the old pod may indefinitely hold device and prevent the new pod from spinning up as the device is not available. Example for your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: Recreate
```

### Bluetooth devices

If you're on metal and using a USB bluetooth apator of some sort, the process is a little different from the above USB Devices section. You probably want to mount dbus. See a `values.yaml` example here:

```yaml
extraVolumes:
  - name: bluetooth
    hostPath:
      path: /run/dbus

extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: bluetooth
    mountPath: /run/dbus
    # note that this is readonly to prevent security issues
    readOnly: true
```

### Mobile config

If you're new to home assistant, you may be wondering how you connect to the companion app on your phone. This requires you to put a key with no value called `mobile:` in the `configuration.yaml`. This would break your values.yaml depending on the gitops solution you're using, so we take the configuration as an in-line yaml block string instead like this:

```yaml
homeAssistant:
  configuration: |
    # this has no value
    mobile:
```

## Status
Seemingly stable. Feel free to submit PRs and Issues though :) It was originally written for use via [this Argo CD app](https://github.com/small-hack/argocd-apps/tree/main/home-assistant) which we deploy on metal with [`smol-k8s-lab`](https://github.com/small-hack/smol-k8s-lab), but it can be used anywhere. The [docker image](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pkgs/container/home-assistant) is kept up to date with [RenovateBot](https://docs.renovatebot.com/).
